This directory is a remnant of the kubebuilder scaffold. Since the PolicyCore is not meant to be a
real CRD, many details have been removed here. The CRD and a sample instance remain as examples.

The samples scaffolded by kubebuilder for projects are often out of date, *however* in this 
repository, the sample is tested in the fakepolicy "basic" suite to ensure that it is not missing
any required fields, or any values that would be defaulted.
