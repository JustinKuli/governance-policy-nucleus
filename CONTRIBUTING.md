# Contributing Guide

The Policy SIG
[Contributing guide](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/community/blob/main/sig-policy/contribution-guidelines.md)
is still a good set of guidelines, even though this is a fork of a (now) archived repository...

If you are interested in contributing to this fork specifically, feel free to open an issue or PR.
If I don't respond, and you really want input, you can probably figure out my firstname.lastname
gmail address on your own.
