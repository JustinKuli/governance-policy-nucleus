Refer to our [Community Security Response](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/community/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

Even though this is a fork, it would be best to disclose potential security vulnerabilities via the
guidelines linked above. Please don't just open an issue, since that can cause other headaches...
I'm not generally a fan of secrecy, but security embargoes are a real (important) thing.
